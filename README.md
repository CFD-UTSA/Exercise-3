# Exercise 3 - For loops and conditional statements (10 points)

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to edit the notebook files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.

After making your changes to the notebook, you will need to upload it to GitHub.


## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 2 repository

Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g. exercise-2-jdoe) into the instance using Git 

## Start working

There are 4 problems in this week's exercise.
1. [Problem 1 - Batch processing data files with a for loop (2 points)](Exercise-3-problem-1.ipynb)
2. [Problem 2 - Classifying temperatures (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-2.ipynb)
3. [Problem 3 - Allocating locations (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-3.ipynb)
4. [Problem 4 - Nested `for` loops (*optional*, 0 points)](Exercise-3-problem-4.ipynb)
